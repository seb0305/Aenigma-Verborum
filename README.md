# Aenigma Verborum (Latin-German Learning Project)

## About

This project is a web-based Latin vocabulary game for students that combines a personal vocab book, adaptive quizzes, and collectible trading cards. Students manually enter Latin words with German translations, then the app generates quiz rounds that focus on the words they struggle with most. After successful quiz answers, players earn AI-generated bronze trading cards featuring artwork and flavor text tied to specific Latin words, and they can view both their per‑word performance stats and their growing card collection in dedicated views.
